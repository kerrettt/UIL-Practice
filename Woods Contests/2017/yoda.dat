We must fight
We should go and look
You must try
Nobody can understand me
You cannot go home
You must use the force
It is time
You must reload the data
We are all doomed
Who ate this chicken
I want punctuation marks
This is difficult
We need more soup
I hope this is almost over
I should run
You are that guy on tv
They ate dinner
We ought to try it
I cannot do that right now
I have more important things to do with my life
Sammy cannot type
Spencer cannot code
Nick cannot be normal
Will will write wills when wills are needed for will
Asher cannot solve his problem
Max thinks strings are mutable
Steven will always get a 240
Yoda was in charge of planning
Ariz is making confusing problems
Rahul is called ral
Sidh is the ultimate squid with his great squiddish power
Sammy put random numbers in his datafile
I solved the judge data
