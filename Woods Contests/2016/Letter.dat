You are the single most inconsistent penguin I have ever had the displeasure
of meeting. In fact, I believe there is no one more inconsistent than you in
a state of being than a penguin can have tacos. You deserve nothing less than
Ubuntu operating systems in your computer. I think you need to quit computer
 Science. In fact it would be better if you left society as a hole and got
rekt while living as a hermit in the woods. I hope to never see you again.
Ok. Yours Truly, Rahul.
