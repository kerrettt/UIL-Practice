To be, or not to be– that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And, by opposing, end them. To die, to sleep
No more – and by a sleep to say we end
The heartache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to- 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep
To sleep, perchance to dream. Ay, there's the rub,
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause. There's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life.

It is a melancholy object to those who walk through this great town or travel in the country, 
when they see the streets, the roads, and cabin doors, crowded with beggars of the female sex, 
followed by three, four, or six children, all in rags and importuning every passenger for an alms. 
These mothers, instead of being able to work for their honest livelihood, are forced to employ 
all their time in strolling to beg sustenance for their helpless infants: who as they grow up 
either turn thieves for want of work, or leave their dear native country to fight for the 
Pretender in Spain, or sell themselves to the Barbadoes.

The Dursleys were so mean and hideous that summer that all Harry Potter wanted was to get back 
to the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. But just as he's packing his bags, Harry 
receives a warning from a strange, impish creature named Dobby who says that if Harry Potter 
returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike.

Arms, and the man I sing, who, forc'd by fate, 
And haughty Juno's unrelenting hate, 
Expell'd and exil'd, left the Trojan shore. 
Long labors, both by sea and land, he bore, 
And in the doubtful war, before he won 
The Latian realm, and built the destin'd town; 
His banish'd gods restor'd to rites divine, 
And settled sure succession in his line, 
From whence the race of Alban fathers come, 
And the long glories of majestic Rome. 
O Muse! the causes and the crimes relate; 
What goddess was provok'd, and whence her hate; 
For what offense the Queen of Heav'n began 
To persecute so brave, so just a man; 
Involv'd his anxious life in endless cares, 
Expos'd to wants, and hurried into wars!

Yossarian looked at him soberly and tried another approach.

	"Is Orr crazy?"

	"He sure is," Doc Daneeka said.

	"Can you ground him?"
	
	"I sure can but first he has to ask me to. That's part of the
rule."

	"Then why doesn't he ask you to?"

	"Because he's crazy," Doc Daneeka said. "He has to be crazy to
keep flying combat missions after all the close calls he's had. Sure I can
ground Orr. But first he has to ask me to."

	"That's all he has to do to be grounded?"

	"That's all. Let him ask me."

	"And then you can ground him?" Yossarian asked.

	"No, then I can't ground him."

	"You mean there's a catch?"

	"Sure there is a catch," Doc Daneeka replied. "Catch-22. Anyone
who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy."

Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of
the Western Spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.
Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an
utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape-descended life
forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are
a pretty neat idea.

Winston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilled his lungs
with air. His mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink.
To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while
telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions
which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in
both of them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while
laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the
Party was the guardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was necessary
to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it
was needed, and then promptly to forget it again: and above all, to apply
the same process to the process itself. That was the ultimate subtlety:
consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become
unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed. Even to
understand the word 'doublethink' involved the use of doublethink.

Isn't it funny
How a bear likes honey?
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!
I wonder why he does?
